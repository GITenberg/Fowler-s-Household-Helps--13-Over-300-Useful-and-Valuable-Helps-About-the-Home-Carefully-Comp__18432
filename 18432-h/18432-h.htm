HOUSEHOLD HELPS</p>
<h1><a name="spot0001" id="spot0001">THE CARE AND USE OF GAS
APPLIANCES</a></h1>
<h2><a name="spot0002" id="spot0002">CARE OF GAS RANGES</a></h2>

<p>In order to get satisfactory and economical service and a long
life, any range or mechanical device must be kept clean. This
applies to the gas range as well, and we therefore wish to
emphasize that the little attention required is very much worth
while.</p>

<p>Clean the top, the ovens and removable drip pan frequently.</p>

<p>Clean broiler griddle and pan <i>every</i> time it is used.</p>

<p>If any burner holes become clogged, clean them out with a
piece of wire or a hairpin.</p>

<p>Keep the air inlets on the shutter at the front of the
burners near the levers clear of dust. The suction at this
point draws the dust, which, if allowed to accumulate, will
cause the flame to burn yellow or red instead of blue.</p>

<p>More ranges rust out than wear out. To keep the range
free from rust rub it very frequently with a cloth slightly
oiled with any kind of oil or grease, except kerosene or one
containing salt; we suggest the use of olive oil or one of
its cheaper substitutes. This is done to the best advantage
while the range is warm.</p>

<p>When the burners become greasy, remove and wash them
thoroughly in soap and hot water. Never black the burners or
top grates.</p>

<p>The broiler pan and rack should be kept out of the range
when oven is being used or it will rust, warp or chip. It
requires the same care any kitchen enamel ware does.</p>
<p>Always leave oven and broiler doors open for a few
minutes after lighting the oven burners and after
extinguishing them. This will dry the inside of the range
and prevent rusting.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0004" id="spot0004">USE OF THE RANGE</a>
<a name="page02a" id="page02a"><!-- Page: 2a --></a>
</h2>

<p>With reasonable care gas is much cheaper for household
cooking than any other fuel.</p>

<p>Every range should be equipped with a top burner lighter
which is convenient and economical, as it is just as easy to
light a burner as to leave it burning.</p>

<p>Never turn on the gas until you are ready to use it.</p>

<p>Turn off the gas as soon as you are through with it.</p>

<p>Turn down the gas as low as possible to give the required
heat. Remember that water boiling rapidly is no hotter than
water boiling slowly.</p>

<p>Always open oven door before lighting oven burners.</p>

<p>Plan your cooking so as to use both broiler and oven at
once. The same burners heat both. While a roast is in the
broiler, bake the cookies, bread, apples or pudding in the
oven. When the latter are done, use the oven to cook
vegetables or bake biscuits.</p>

<p>To boil foods in the oven, utensils should be set
directly on the bottom of the oven.</p>

<p>By following this plan both the time required to cook the
meal and your fuel expense will be reduced to a minimum.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0005" id="spot0005">BROILING AND ROASTING</a></h2>

<p>Broiling and roasting are the same form of cooking, the
former term being applied to thinner and the latter to
thicker foodstuffs. They consist of cooking at very high
temperatures, obtained only by exposure to the direct
flame.</p>

<p>It must be done in the broiler, which should be lighted
ten minutes before cooking commences.</p>

<p>Always leave broiler door open and put a little cold
water in the bottom of the broiler pan to prevent the food
from burning. Place the food to be cooked on the cold rack
in the broiling pan.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0006" id="spot0006">STEAKS AND CHOPS</a>
<a name="page03a" id="page03a"><!-- Page: 3a --></a>
</h2>

<p>Place the meat about two inches from the fire until well
seared. Turn over and sear other side in the same way, thus
preventing the escape of the juice. Then lower the pan and
turn down the gas until the meat is done to taste. For steak
allow about 10 minutes if one inch thick, 15 minutes if one
and one-half inches thick. For chops allow 8 minutes.
Cooking may be done faster, but proper tenderness of meats
can only be had at the slower rates.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0007" id="spot0007">FISH</a></h2>

<p>Place fish on the rack, skin side down, and do not turn.
Place rack in lower part of oven. Baste liberally and turn
down gas when the fish begins to brown. Allow 20 to 30
minutes.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0008" id="spot0008">OTHER FOODS</a></h2>

<p>Chicken, bacon, liver, ham, tripe, and vegetables, such
as tomatoes, peppers, Spanish onions, can also be broiled to
perfection in a manner similar to above.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0009" id="spot0009">ROAST MEATS</a></h2>

<p>Roast meats should be treated the same as steaks and
chops, except that after the meat is seared the cooking
should be done more slowly, which will, of course, take more
time. This part of the cooking can be done with the broiler
door closed, or can be done in the upper or baking oven.
Allow about 20 minutes to the pound for a roast.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0010" id="spot0010">BAKING</a></h2>

<p>Baking is cooking at moderate temperatures in a range
oven. The oven should be lighted from 5 to 10 minutes
(depending upon the food to be cooked) before the food is
put in.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0011" id="spot0011">BREAD</a></h2>

<p>Heat the oven about 5 minutes before using, and bake from
45 to 50 minutes on the lower rack.
<a name="page04a" id="page04a"><!-- Page: 4a --></a>
Bread should be baked in a hot oven, should continue to rise
about 15 minutes, brown for 20 minutes longer, and bake 15
minutes longer with a reduced flame.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0012" id="spot0012">BISCUITS</a></h2>

<p>Heat oven for 10 minutes. Put biscuits in oven and bake
for 5 minutes with full heat, then turn gas off completely
and bake 5 minutes longer.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0013" id="spot0013">LOAF CAKE</a></h2>

<p>Heat oven 5 minutes. Place the cake on the rack about 3
inches from bottom of oven. Turn gas half on for about 30
minutes when the cake should have fully risen. Increase heat
enough to make the top brown and crisp.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0014" id="spot0014">LAYER CAKE</a></h2>

<p>Layer cake should be placed in a hotter oven than loaf
cake. Heat oven 10 minutes. Place cake on rack in center of
oven and turn out the gas for 10 minutes. Relight both
burners turned half down for 12 or 15 minutes. If not
sufficiently browned increase the heat at the last.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0015" id="spot0015">BOILING</a></h2>

<p>Boiling is cooking in water at a temperature of 212
degrees. This is done on the open burners on top of the
range. There are three sizes of burners: the giant, the
ordinary and the simmerer. In bringing water to boil quickly
use the giant burner, then continue boiling on the simmerer
or one of the ordinary burners turned low. Do not waste gas
by boiling hard. Use covers on kettles.</p>

<p>Green vegetables when boiling retain their color better
if the lid is left off the pot.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0016" id="spot0016">STEWING</a></h2>

<p>Stewing is cooking in a small amount of water for a long
time at simmering temperature. It is the
<a name="page05a" id="page05a"><!-- Page: 5a --></a>
most economical way of cooking the cheaper cuts of meat. The
simmering burner should be used for this cooking.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0017" id="spot0017">TOASTERS</a></h2>

<p>Bread toasters placed on the top burners of a gas range
supply a quick and the most satisfactory method of preparing
toast. Large quantities of toast can be made to advantage in
the broiler.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0018" id="spot0018">GAS WATER HEATERS</a></h2>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Gas water heaters supply the
most economical and convenient source of hot water
obtainable.</p>

<p>The automatic water heaters are made to heat water
instantly and automatically upon opening any hot water
faucet in the system. These heaters are made in various
capacities from 2 to 8 gallons per minute.</p>

<p>Circulating tank heaters which are attached to the
kitchen boiler have to be lighted every time they are
used.</p>

<p>Usually the heater is lighted a few minutes before hot
water is required, the time depending upon the amount likely
to be used. A 30-gallon tank may be heated in approximately
one hour. Sufficient hot water for an average bath may be
had in fifteen minutes. The most economical way to handle
the circulating tank heater, when water is needed for a
bath, is as follows:</p>

<p>Light heater and turn on faucet so that the water will
flow into the tub as quickly as it is heated in the tank.
This is usually at the rate of one gallon per minute.</p>

<p>According to the city ordinance, in residences where
water meter check valves are installed on the water service,
the consumer should supply a safety
<a name="page06a" id="page06a"><!-- Page: 6a --></a>
water relief valve before connecting any hot water system.
This must be done to take care of the expansion.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0019" id="spot0019">GAS FLAT IRONS</a></h2>

<p>The gas flat iron is a most satisfactory and economical
household appliance.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0020" id="spot0020">FURNACE CONNECTIONS</a></h2>

<p>A pipe coil should be placed in every furnace and
connected to the hot water tank in order to insure an
economical supply of hot water during the period when the
furnace is in use. This makes it possible to use the gas
range in the kitchen and enjoy its convenience and economy
the year round.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0021" id="spot0021">ALL-GAS KITCHENS</a></h2>

<p>All-gas kitchens embodying the foregoing appliances are
in general use owing to their convenience and economy.</p>

<p>Details regarding these kitchen appliances and other gas
appliances, such as fireplace kindlers, furnace kindlers,
coke box kindlers, garbage burners, gas steam radiators, gas
water radiators, safety garage heaters and ironing machines
may be obtained from your Gas Company. Telephone them, for
their salesmen are always glad to serve you.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0022" id="spot0022">DEMONSTRATOR</a></h2>

<p>Most gas companies have a practical and expert
demonstrator whose services are free. When any gas appliance
is not giving perfect satisfaction in every way, or once a
year on general principles, you should ask the demonstrator
to call.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0023" id="spot0023">GAS LIGHTING</a>
<a name="page07a" id="page07a"><!-- Page: 7a --></a>
</h2>

<p>Correct, healthful and pleasing lighting conditions do
more than anything else to brighten, modernize and make
comfortable the house of today. Poor light is poor economy
in more than one sense of the term.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor light&#8221; may mean too little or too much
light, a wrong kind of light or a misplaced source of light.
Any of these conditions cause eye strain. Eye strain results
in eye troubles and inevitably affects the general health.
Furthermore, the well lighted home is an attractive center
for the family, while a badly lighted house creates gloom
and a restless atmosphere.</p>

<p>Gas light offers convenience in lighting and beauty in
its fixtures.</p>

<p>Gas light presents the real economy of the best at the
least cost.</p>

<p>All new houses should be piped for gas. Even an old house
can be equipped with ceiling, wall and baseboard outlets
with but little expense or inconvenience to you. Your Gas
Company will also help you to select just the fixtures and
burners you need to harmonize with the decorations in your
home and to supply the best possible light for each
room.</p>

<p>At your call, the Company will keep your equipment in
thoroughly efficient condition. You should use only the best
gas mantles. It sells them at cost to you in order to
encourage their use&#8212;cheap mantles are cheap in first
cost and expensive in the long run.</p>

<p>Your Gas Company prides itself on being &#8220;at your
service.&#8221;</p>

<h1><a name="spot0024" id="spot0024">ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES</a>
<a name="page08a" id="page08a"><!-- Page: 8a --></a>
</h1>

<h2><a name="spot0025" id="spot0025">ELECTRIC SERVICE IN THE
HOME</a></h2>

<p>The home that is completely wired has at hand a tireless
electric servant-of-all-work; for the past few years have
seen the invention and perfection of devices for doing
household labor of practically every description. These are
of practical economy not only when used by the housewife,
but also in making domestic help more efficient and better
satisfied.</p>

<p>In addition to the almost universal use of electricity
for lighting, with every facility for flexibility and
convenience in connecting and control, electricity may be
absolutely depended upon today for washing, wringing, drying
and ironing the clothes, for sweeping and dusting, for
polishing, for cleaning silver and brightwork, for all
cooking, for such culinary processes as beating eggs, mixing
bread, grinding meat or coffee, turning the ice cream
freezer or sharpening knives, or, on emergency, for heating
or cooling the house. And (contrary to popular belief), in
most of these cases electricity offers an opportunity for
actual domestic economy.</p>

<p>Electricity is no longer a rich man&#8217;s luxury, for
its convenience, cleanliness, time saving and economy, as
shown by the following pages, have made it every man&#8217;s
necessity.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0026" id="spot0026">ALL-ELECTRIC HOMES</a></h2>

<p>The model home is electrically lighted, has the kitchen
equipped with an electric range, electric dishwasher,
electric kitchen set for beating eggs, grinding, mixing and
polishing; the dining-room equipped with electric coffee
percolator, electric samovar and an electric toaster;
laundry equipped with electric washing machine, motor-driven
mangle heated by gas or electricity, and an electric iron. A
vacuum cleaner is essential in every household. Other
appliances which will prove their value if once
<a name="page09a" id="page09a"><!-- Page: 9a --></a>
tried are heating pads, vibrators, heating or disk stoves,
luminous radiators, sewing machines, fans, pressing iron for
the sewing-room and Christmas tree outfits.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0027" id="spot0027">ELECTRIC RANGE</a></h2>

<p>Cooking by electricity is an ideal method, and the
electric range makes it practical. Every housewife should be
familiar with its advantages as it provides the most
satisfactory results.</p>

<p>The electric range is reliable, efficient and durable. It
saves time, work, worry and watching. It promotes safety,
comfort and cleanliness.</p>

<p>The electric range is convenient and easy to operate, as
the heat is always instantly available and readily regulated
at the turn of a switch. Cooking becomes a certainty, as the
same switch position always provides the same amount of
heat. All the heat is concentrated on the cooking and there
is no excess heat wasted on other parts of the range or
radiated out into the room. Ordinary cooking utensils are
used as with other ranges.</p>

<p>Cooking with an electric range can be done at a
reasonable cost in consideration of the many inherent
advantages above referred to.</p>

<p>The roasting of meat to the exact degree desired need not
be the dread of the cook when an electric oven is available.
The uniformity and reliability of the heat of the electric
oven facilitates the roasting of meat without constant
attention and worry.</p>

<p>Electric broiling insures tender chops and steaks, as the
surface of the meat is quickly seared and all its juicy
tenderness is retained.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the use of the electric range,
your Lighting Company gives an instruction book with every
installation.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0028" id="spot0028">ELECTRIC DISHWASHER</a></h2>

<p>After each meal scrape off the dishes and place them in
the washer in such a position that the water can be thrown
against both sides of them. It is
<a name="page10a" id="page10a"><!-- Page: 10a --></a>
convenient to accumulate enough dishes to fill the washer,
as it may thereby become possible to do all of the
day&#8217;s dishes in one washing.</p>

<p>Shake washing powder or liquid soap into the machine and
add one-quarter of a cup of ammonia. Pour in the right
amount of hot water from faucet (according to instructions
with machine) and allow the machine to run about 10 minutes.
Then let the water run out and pour in a little more to wash
out the sediment. Close the drain and pour in boiling water
which acts as a rinsing water. Run the machine two minutes
more and drain. Raise cover immediately after the machine is
stopped to let the steam out. The dishes will dry by
themselves with high polish, but it is necessary to wipe the
silver and glassware.</p>

<p>The washer is then ready to be used as a storage for
dishes until needed again.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0029" id="spot0029">VACUUM CLEANER</a></h2>

<p>There are many good electric vacuum cleaners on the
market, all of which operate on the same general principle
of suction. The Hoover, however, has a motor-driven brush in
addition, which acts as a sweeper.</p>

<p>Oil the motor with a drop or two each time it is used,
according to the directions given with the machine. If using
a Hoover, the brush bearings should not be oiled as they are
made of wood.</p>

<p>Should the brush become stuck it is due to threads,
string and hair which have been collected by it. Remove the
brush according to directions supplied with the machine and
free all the bearings.</p>

<p>Clean the bag after using by carefully removing it from
the machine and shaking the dirt on a newspaper.</p>

<p>Once a month the machine should be cleaned by taking off
the bag, lifting the machine from the carpet and allowing
the machine to run for a couple of minutes.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0030" id="spot0030">SEWING MACHINE</a>
<a name="page11a" id="page11a"><!-- Page: 11a --></a>
</h2>

<p>Follow directions supplied with the machine as to oiling
and proper size of needle, thread, etc. Do not make any
adjustments unless you are sure you know how. These
adjustments require patience, as the adjusting screws must
be turned a very little at a time to note the effect
produced. Do not run the machine at too high a speed as this
will shorten its life.</p>

<p>When putting a motor on a foot-power machine be sure that
the old machine is not over-speeded.</p>

<p>If your machine is provided with a foot release be sure
that the release entirely cuts off current, otherwise the
motor will run very hot.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0031" id="spot0031">FLAT IRON</a></h2>

<p>There are several makes of electric irons which do
excellent work and have a long life. The standard sizes are
3, 6 and 8 pounds. The 6-pound iron is best adapted for
general household use.</p>

<p>If the iron becomes too hot, disconnect the lead from the
iron. In case the terminals become corroded, rub them with a
piece of fine emery cloth to remove corrosion. If the
contacts become corroded or bent they should be
replaced.</p>

<p>Your Lighting Company maintains a repair department for
all heating and cooking appliances. Telephone Sales
Department.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0032" id="spot0032">ELECTRIC LAMPS</a></h2>

<p>Mazda lamps are the most efficient lamps obtainable and their
use is recommended for all classes of service. Your electric bills
depend upon the watts per lamp and the number of hours of use. Note
in the following table that the Mazda lamps give on the average two
and one-half times as much light for the same cost as the Gem
carbon lamps. The column &#8220;Cost of current per month&#8221;
gives the cost of burning one lamp one hour per day for one month
at the maximum rate of nine cents per K. W. H.

<p>In installing lamps for the cellar the time they are lighted
should be borne in mind. As this is short, the expense of running
larger lamps&#8212;25 watt and 40 watt&#8212;is insignificant. The
following locations should be provided for:</p>

<p>Bottom of cellar stairs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
25 watt</p>

<p>Work bench&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
40 watt</p>

<p>Laundry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Lamp in front of furnace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
60 watt</p>

<p>This latter lamp is usually close enough to also
illuminate the coal bin.</p>

<h3><a name="spot0054" id="spot0054">Care of Lamps and
Fixtures</a></h3>

<p>Lamps and fixtures should he cleaned once a month to
insure the maximum efficiency. Reliable tests have shown
that dirty glassware reduces effective illumination from 10
to 50 per cent.</p>

one at foot of stairs, one at work bench, one in fruit and
vegetable cellar and one in front of furnace located so as
also to illuminate the coal bin.</p>

<p>A control switch and telltale lamp should be provided in
the kitchen.</p>

<h3><a name="spot0064" id="spot0064">Attic</a></h3>

<p>Two outlets are usually sufficient. A control switch and

<a name="page15a" id="page15a"><!-- Page: 15a --></a>
</h3>

<p>A rigid pendant with a chain-pull socket should be
provided for each dark clothes press.</p>

<p>It is most convenient and practical to have these lights
operated by an automatic switch which is opened and closed
by the closing and opening of the closet door. This provides
a light immediately the door is opened, while when the door
is shut one may be sure that the light has not been left
burning.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0066" id="spot0066">GENERAL</a></h2>

<p>Baseboard outlets should be installed in all rooms for
the use of vacuum cleaner, fans, or other portable
appliances.</p>

<p>Bell-ringing transformers which provide current for door
bells and buzzers should be installed for each
apartment.</p>

<p>Emergency gas lights should be provided for the halls,
kitchen, dining-room and bathroom.</p>

<p>If any special requirements are not provided for in the
above recommendations your Lighting Company will be glad to
give you expert advice free of charge. They pride themselves
on being at your service.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0067" id="spot0067">WIRING HINTS</a></h2>

<p>The service entrance should be of sufficient capacity to
care for additional load in the form of electric heating,
cooking and other domestic appliances. The branch circuits
should be heavy and numerous enough to care for additional
outlets for lighting and appliances as found desirable. Your
Lighting Company will be glad to go over your plans with
you.</p>

<p>The electric meters should be located in the cellar near
the gas meter, as this will save you the annoyance of meter
readers and testers going through the house to the
attic.</p>

<p>Be sure and install control switches and telltale lamps
on cellar and attic lights.</p>

<p><a name="page16a" id="page16a"><!-- Page: 16a --></a>
Provide three-way switches in the halls so that the hall
lights may be controlled from either the first or second
floor.</p>

<p>All ceiling outlet lighting, and wherever desirable, side
bracket lighting, should be controlled by wall switches.
These switches should preferably be of the push-button type
rather than of the snap-switch type. In general the best
location for these switches is on the wall of the room right
next to the door which is the entrance most frequently
used.</p>

<h2><a name="spot0068" id="spot0068">FUSES</a></h2>

<p>Fuses on your electrical wiring act in the same capacity
as a safety valve on a steam boiler. Whenever there is an
overload on the circuit or a short circuit these fuses blow
and relieve the strain on your wiring.</p>

<p>When in doubt or when in need of suggestions,
&#8217;phone the Sales Department of your Lighting
Company.</p>

them stand tightly covered for five or six hours. The nut
meats may then be extracted easily without a trace of the
bitter lining of the nut. Use a nut cracker and crack

whole.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
